*"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Clarke's Third Law*

Above is the most famous of the "Three Laws" formulated a half-century ago by science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.  It is more of an adage than a hard-and-fast "law", but it concisely summarizes how I felt about programming when I first tried it about two years ago by completing Codecademy's HTML, CSS and Javascript courses.  It was fascinating to see how one could turn a string of letters on a screen into a living, breathing, webpage that looked like those that we visit every day.  But to me, having just graduated with a liberal arts degree, and still trying to figure out "what I want to be when I grow up," making such a dramatic shift seemed unrealistic.  After all, I had no hard math or science background to begin with.  

Arabic always seemed like magic to me too, particularly when I was first starting to learn it.  I wondered about the meaning behind the mysterious letters laying together on the pages I looked over in our infamous "Al-Kitab" textbooks.  The mere appearance of the language, even in its simplest forms, was aesthetically pleasing.

This was not entirely by coincidence.  Arabs tend to be very proud of their language, and for good reason.  While travelling in the Middle East during my year abroad in, 2013-2014, I have many memories of sitting in a taxi while the driver eagerly demonstrated his knowledge in the most formal variety, Modern Standard Arabic, by reciting adages, poetry, or excerpts from the Quran.  Modern Standard Arabic is used in formal contexts all over the Middle East, but it is extraordinarily complicated by design.  Partially for this reason, many people who are native speakers of a particular (simpler) Arabic dialect go their entire lives without learning the basics.  When used fluently and with vigour, it carries an air of authority and an almost mystical quality.  Its importance to Arab and Islamic art cannot be overstated; Arabic caligrapy adorns the walls of even the most humble mosques.  When skillfully drawn, the caligraphy is simultaneously simple, intricate, and beautiful.

Perhaps it is something similar that originally drew me to coding; even when doing something as simple as accidentally hitting F12 while using Google Chrome, the strings of mysterious, seemingly gibberish letters that would appear carried an almost mystical and authoritative quality.  This is certainly not lost on most programmers, particularly among Rubyists, whose emphasis on "beautiful code" is endemic in the Ruby language itself.  

So, during my brief foray into programming back in the summer of 2015, shortly after finishing an International Affairs / Middle East Studies degree from GWU, the surprising similarities between human and computer languages jumped out at me.  At the time, it did not seem practical to make such a dramatic career shift so soon after graduating, but it soon became clear to me that I would not particularly enjoy a life of working in the careers that my degree had prepared me for.  Remembering how I had so enjoyed programming, I decided to give it another try, enrolling in Udacity's short "Intro to Programming" Nanodegree as a trial-run, telling myself that if I were able to finish that program, that I would seriously consider taking another, larger step in that direction.

As it turns out, I enjoyed every minute of it.  I enjoyed it because it allowed me to combine my passion for languages, the satisfaction I get from practical problem-solving, and my need for creative expression all into one activity that would actually pay the bills.  Having spent a year working a demanding paralegal job that basically did not involve any of these things, I understood the value of what I had found.  Most people work for a living, but very few ever find work that they can honestly say they love.  Just a few years ago, making this change would have been nearly impossible, but I am lucky enough to live in a time where a wealth of information is just a click away.  I am very lucky that this opportunity has been presented to me, and I am going to take it.
